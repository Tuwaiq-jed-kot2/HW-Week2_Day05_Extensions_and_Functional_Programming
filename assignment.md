# Kotlin Essentials (Extensions and Functional Programming Basics)
---
The Kotlin assignment has two components
- Practice with Extensions.
- Practice with Functional Programming Basics.

> Note: You must save your solution in `solution_part1.kt` for Part I, and `solution_part2.kt` for Part II.

## Part I - Extensions.
---
- Create an extension that replace repetative double characters in string (ex.: aa) to (**). ( optional )
- Create an extension that prints any number value in reverse order.

## Part II - Functional Programming Basics.
---
- Create 3 functional chains using map, flatMap, and filter.
- Using a functional programming approach using this list 
  val valuesToAdd = listOf(1, 18, 73, 3, 44, 6, 1, 33, 2, 22, 5, 7, 32, 11, 9, 8, 24)
    1. Exclude any number less than 7.
    2. Multiply each number by 2.
    3. Sum the resulting products to produce a final number.
